In Windows 7/8/10, the virus is killed by Windows Defender. However, Windows XP systems usually get infected and spread it into portable disks. 

Sometimes all files on your portable disk or even PC becomes shortcut due to infection by this computer virus, do not worry.

The only thing you should do is to download the python file, specify the drive that needs to recover, and then wait for a minute:)
